TESTS
--------

TEST_1: A simulation that works in a loop for exploring the relevant parameters in the simulations (alpha & beta). It already works
for reproducing the obtained results (see README.txt inside)

TEST_2b: A simulation that works without performing a loop. Changes in relevant variables are writen in the file 'Run.bash' sequentially.
(see README.txt inside)
